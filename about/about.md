# About

This is just a _very_ simple blog where I wanted to just do the thing that all blogs were intended to do...write. But the continual problem that I've found over the years is that writing for and on the internet is hard. Every simple solution to just write on the internet either comes with a learning curve or worst yet, a cost. The continual maintenance of keeping a site up to date is takes away from doing the thing that you were supposed to in the first place, **write**.

Sure, I could just pay for a hosting service and have them take care of it. Or I could sign up for something like SquareSpace or Ghost and set it and forget it. But then I'm locked into a platform that I can really move away from. And I wouldn't _own_ anything. So here I am, at it again, but this time just using the KISS and moving on with life. I might spruce this up a bit with some CSS, but honestly, I don't want to waste time with trying to design something. I just want to write.
