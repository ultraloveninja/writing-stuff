I got back home the other day from a snowboard trip to Keystone in Colorado. While I've been snowboarding in Colorado before at some smaller areas, I've always wanted to hit up a "big" mountain. Some of my old high school buddies starting doing these yearly trips, and I was able to cobble up the time to make it this year. I was epic and we had some snow roll through overnight so the day we got up to go ride, there was some good powder. Being from the Midwest I knew that the altitude would be an issue, so I used an altitude mask that I had used in the past before I headed out to the mile high city. Overall, it helped a bit, but there's not much you can do to try and pump oxygen into your lungs at roughy 12,000 feet of elevation. Regardless, it was an epic time and I hope to do it again next year.
